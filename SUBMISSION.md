# ShipFeed — AI-Powered Changelog Platform

## The Problem
Product teams struggle to communicate updates effectively. Release notes are often buried in GitHub or changelog docs nobody reads. This hurts feature adoption, user engagement, and retention.

## The Solution
ShipFeed is an AI-native changelog platform. Teams connect product changes, generate high-quality release-note drafts, publish beautiful updates, and automatically notify subscribers. It turns release notes into a growth and retention channel.
